OpenAI Case Study
Jungho Lee

OpenAI is one of the world's leaders in AI research and software. The company focuses their efforts on creating products of general artificial intelligence, most notably through their software ChatGPT. Their other products include DALL-E, a text to image software and Sora, a text to video software. ChatGPT was incorporated on December 11th, 2015. There are many founders, but the co-chairs and most notable members are Sam Altman and Elon Musk. OpenAI began as non-profit organization aimed at advancing efforts towards artificial intelligence research. Since launch, they have been able to receive large amounts of funding, beginning with a combined $1 billion donation from multiple tech moguls and other benefactors at their inception.

The goal of OpenAI is to be a pioneer in human efforts towards creating increasingly complex machines of artificial intelligence. More specifically, their goal is to reach capabilites of 'AGI', or artifical general intelligence, which they defined as a "highly autonomous system that outperforms humans". As stated in their charter, their main goal is to use this technology for the betterment of humanity. Being a non-profit would allow the company to strive for technological advancements without the financial pressures of a typical tech company. When the company transitioned into a for-profit model in 2019, they split into two entities - OpenAI Inc., and OpenAI Global LLC. The former, which was a continuation of the non-profit faction of the company, would maintain controlling shareholder rights. The for-profit division would have to answer to the non-profit division to maintain financially unadulterated motivations. The point of the for-profit division was to garner additional funding resources for the rapidly growing company.

The target customer base for OpenAI ranges broadly based upon the functions of its various products. ChatGPT is accessible to anyone, reaching 200 million monthly users worldwide as of June 2023. The capabilties of the technology are so broad that many people are finding uses for it in their daily lives. ChatGPT technology also has many applications in corporate settings, whether tasks as simple as enhanced communication or as complex as debugging code.

With the explosive growth of OpenAI and ChatGPT, many competitors began to develop their own AI models with similar goals. Google's Bard and Gemini, as well as Meta AI and Microsoft Copilot are just a few competitors launched by tech giants. When compared to its competitors, ChatGPT boasts the most extensive set of training data, and it has been reported that the software had run out of new material to feed its deep machine learning algorithm, as the entirety of the internet had already been scraped. Further, as the first in its field, OpenAI and ChatGPT continue to be the frontrunners in creating the newest advancements in AI through pushing updated versions of its software.

OpenAI and its products are in the field of generative AI, in which AI uses models to create new content based on user input. The technology used by ChatGPT is called deep learning, which allows the software to create human-like text through transformer neural networks. Its primary focus is on natural language processing through this deep learning, which aims for the complete understanding of human language beyond the literal meaning of individual words. Human language is very complex, and it is extremely difficult to express its nuances in a way that a computer might accurately understand human meaning. Through strategies such as sentiment analysis and natural language recognition, generation, and understanding, ChatGPT has gradually improved in the task of understanding natural language and producing it in a reciprocative manner.

In the last decade, the field of NLP has made great strides in technological advancement. The capabilities of ChatGPT in mimicking and understanding human conversation make previous chatbot technologies look archaic in comparison. 

The business impacts of OpenAI have been astounding. Other companies have been using OpenAI's ChatGPT-3 model in a variety of industries. In healthcare, the technology has been used to expedite and diagnoses and patient care; in retail, it has been used to enhance customer experiences; in finance, fraud detection and risk management are two problems that are tackled by OpenAI's technology.

AI companies are judged by model performance, size of user base, in addition to financial success and research prowess. OpenAI has excellent models, publishes groundbreaking research, and has continued to attract significant funding throughout their lifespan. OpenAI has highly successful models in ChatGPT for language generation and DALL-E for image creation. They have also been able to garner significant amounts of funding reaching a total of $11.3 billion. When compared to its competitors, OpenAI is considered one of top, if not best companies working in generative AI.

If I was to advise OpenAI, I would suggest that they integrate automation into their generative AI. If they were to release an assistive bot that acts like a more sophisticated version of existing products like Siri or Bixby, it would push the company forward towards greater appliations with larger audiences. This new addition would likely build upon existing technologies but with the integration of ChatGPT's deep learning model.
